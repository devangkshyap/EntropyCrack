# EntropyCrack
EntropyCrack is a web-based password security toolkit designed to analyze, generate, and evaluate password strength using real-world attack simulations and entropy-based metrics.  This project helps users understand how secure their passwords are by simulating dictionary attacks, bounded brute-force attempts, and breach checks
